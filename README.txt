Knightfall is a 2D sprite-based metroidvania involving the adventure of a amnesiac bandit struggling to remember his past and rectify his previous wrongs.
I'm currently in the process of building the game using self-taught Unity knowledge and experience gained from on-campus courses and clubs.

Implentation:
Knightfall is fully created using the Unity Engine. All code is written in C# and all assets are free from the Unity Asset Store.
